# Credits
* archerpz on the Resident Evil Modding forums - for giving me the first idea of the structure of the HIRC section of nbnks
* the brave soul/s who wrote the Xentax wiki page on WWise Soundbanks - for giving me a general structure of the nbnk that was needed to make the template
* Elliot in the MHW Modding Discord - various things, but especially the file extension to file name list
* bnnm for his [wwiser](https://github.com/bnnm/wwiser) repository, a fantastic source for WWise BNK file structure.
